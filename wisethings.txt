Q:	What do they call the alphabet in Arkansas?
A:	The impossible dream.
Green light in A.M. for new projects.  Red light in P.M. for traffic tickets.
Q:	Why does Washington have the most lawyers per capita and
	New Jersey the most toxic waste dumps?
A:	God gave New Jersey first choice.
So this is it.  We're going to die.
You are taking yourself far too seriously.
